## Why Halo?

Halo is an AI workstation powered by frontier Agent with a pluggable engine architecture — supporting [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), and more. With a complete product layer totaling over 300,000 lines of code, validated by tens of thousands of users, and running stably in enterprise environments, Halo delivers:

| What Halo delivers |
|:---:|
| **Your Daily AI Partner** — coding, product design, operations, writing, research — your everyday work companion |
| **100% Local, Zero Cloud Dependency** — data never leaves your machine, meets enterprise compliance requirements |
| **AI Digital Humans** — AI workers running autonomously 7x24, handling monitoring, reports, and routine operations |
| **AI Browser** — embedded browser directly controlled by AI, automate any web-based system |
| **WeCom / WeChat Native Control** — manage AI agents from enterprise IM, zero training cost |
| **Remote Access** — control from phone / H5 / WeChat / Android, managers review progress on the go |
| **Download and Go** — zero configuration, no backend required, IT deploys in minutes |

> 100% compatible with Claude Code's Agent capabilities, MCP, and Skills.

## AI Digital Humans — Your Autonomous AI Workforce

Traditional RPA follows rigid scripts and breaks when anything changes. Halo takes a different approach: **AI makes the decisions, Halo Browser Skills handle the operations.** The result is automation that understands context, adapts to changes, and executes with precision.

### Autonomous Agents Running 7x24

Create an AI Digital Human, give it a task and an execution frequency, and it runs autonomously on schedule. No screen to watch, no scripts to babysit.

**Social & Content Platform Automation:**

- Auto-reply to comments and DMs on Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, Zhihu
- Publish scheduled content across Twitter / X, WeChat Official Accounts
- Monitor brand mentions and competitor activity, generate daily digests
- Track trending topics and automatically draft content suggestions

**Enterprise Internal Automation:**

- Patrol internal OA / CRM / ERP systems, flag overdue tickets and anomalies
- Generate daily standup reports from Jira / GitLab / GitHub activity
- Monitor CI/CD pipelines, notify on build failures, auto-create incident tickets
- Run scheduled compliance checks on internal dashboards
- Collect cross-department data and assemble weekly executive summaries

Install with one click from the **AI Digital Human Store**, deploy a **private store** for your organization, or create your own using natural language.

> Think of it as cron + RPA + AI Agent in one — except you just describe what you want in plain language.

AI Digital Humans have the exact same Agent capabilities as conversation mode — the same Claude engine, MCP toolchain, and AI Browser — they just trigger automatically on schedule without needing you at the computer.

**WeChat / WeCom is your control panel.** AI Digital Humans support two-way conversational control via personal WeChat / WeCom (Enterprise WeChat) — not just receiving notifications, you can give instructions, check progress, and request reports directly in your enterprise IM.

### Halo Browser Skill — AI Decides, Scripts Execute

This is what separates Halo from "AI browser agents" that fumble around clicking randomly.

Halo Browser Skill takes the RPA approach to reliability: **pre-write reusable scripts for common operations on each platform**. The AI only decides *what* to do and *when* — the script already knows *how*.

Scripts run directly in a real browser via Halo's `browser_run` — with full access to the page DOM, cookies, and internal APIs, just like the Chrome DevTools Console. This works for public platforms and private enterprise systems alike.

**Example: Reading Bilibili notifications**

```js
// .claude/skills/bili-get-messages/index.js
async (params) => {
  const resp = await fetch('https://api.bilibili.com/x/msgfeed/reply?platform=web', {
    credentials: 'include'  // cookies automatically included, no extra auth
  }).then(r => r.json())

  return {
    success: true,
    notifications: resp.data.items.map(item => ({
      user: item.user.nickname,
      comment: item.item.source_content,
      video_title: item.item.title
    }))
  }
}
```

AI calls it with: `browser_run({ file: ".claude/skills/bili-get-messages/index.js" })`

**Example: Enterprise workflow — a Xiaohongshu content operations Digital Human:**
1. AI decides: time to check for new comments on today's posts
2. Calls `xhs-get-comments` Skill → script fetches comment list via platform API
3. AI judges: these 5 comments need replies, drafts personalized responses
4. Calls `xhs-reply-comment` Skill → script submits each reply

**Example: Enterprise internal — a DevOps monitoring Digital Human:**
1. AI decides: time for the hourly infra check
2. Calls `check-grafana-alerts` Skill → script reads alert dashboard via internal API
3. AI judges: 2 alerts are critical, composes an incident summary
4. Calls `create-jira-ticket` Skill → script creates a P1 ticket with full context
5. Calls `notify-oncall` Skill → pushes alert to WeCom on-call group

**AI decides. Skills execute. Stable, repeatable, auditable.**

Ready-made Skills are available for Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, Zhihu, Twitter / X, WeChat, and more. Enterprise teams can write private Skills for internal systems. The community can contribute and share their own.

### Remote Access — Manage Your AI Fleet From Anywhere

Once Remote Access is enabled, your phone / H5 / WeChat / Android client can control Halo on your desktop. During meetings, commuting, or on the road — check Digital Human outputs, approve decisions, and issue new instructions without being at your desk.

## The Story of Halo

In October 2025, a simple frustration: **I wanted to use Claude Code, but I was stuck in meetings all day.**

During a boring meeting, I thought: *What if I could control Claude Code on my home computer from my phone?*

Then came the second problem — non-technical colleagues wanted to use it too, but got stuck at installation. *"What's npm?"*

So I built Halo: a visual interface, one-click install, remote access. The first version took a few hours. Everything after that? **100% built by Halo itself.**

Now, we believe the next step is the **AI Workstation**: AI no longer needs someone watching to get work done. You set the goals, AI Digital Humans push forward autonomously 7x24. Writing code, running tests, monitoring deployments, generating reports — running continuously, with you only making decisions at key checkpoints.

That's what Halo is building.
