## Why Halo?

Halo is built on top of [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), with a complete product layer totaling over 300,000 lines of code, validated by tens of thousands of users, and running stably in enterprise environments. On top of that, Halo also delivers:

| What Halo delivers |
|:---:|
| **Artifact Rail** — preview code, HTML, and images in real time |
| **Remote Access** — control from phone / H5 / WeChat / Android anytime |
| **AI Digital Humans** run automatically 7x24, you just make decisions |
| **Download and go**, zero configuration, non-technical users welcome |
| **AI Browser** — embedded browser directly controlled by AI |

> Powered by [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) — 100% compatible with Claude Code's Agent capabilities, MCP, and Skills.

## Your AI Doesn't Need You Watching

Most AI tools require you to sit in front of the screen, going back and forth in conversation. Halo is different — it can work on its own, and you only need to make decisions at key checkpoints.

### AI Digital Humans — AI Workers Running Autonomously 7x24

Create an AI Digital Human, give it a task and an execution frequency, and it will run autonomously on schedule:

- Push a tech news digest every morning
- Check online service status every hour and notify you of anomalies
- Run competitive analysis on a schedule and generate comparison reports
- Monitor GitHub dependency updates and security vulnerabilities
- Track keyword mentions across social media

Install with one click from the **AI Digital Human Store**, or create your own using natural language.

> Think of it as a cron job + AI Agent hybrid — except you just speak in plain language.

AI Digital Humans have the exact same Agent capabilities as conversation mode — the same Claude engine, MCP toolchain, and AI Browser — they just trigger automatically on schedule without needing you at the computer.

**WeChat is your control panel.** AI Digital Humans support two-way conversational control via personal WeChat / WeCom (Enterprise WeChat) — not just receiving notifications, you can give instructions to AI Digital Humans, check progress, and request reports directly in WeChat.

### Browser Skill — Making AI-Driven Website Operations Stable and Reliable

Typical AI browser automation has the AI fumble around figuring out what to click and fill every time, which frequently fails.

Browser Skill takes a different approach: **pre-write reusable scripts for common operations on each website**. The AI only needs to decide "which script to call now" — the script already handles the specifics of how to operate the website.

Skill scripts run directly in a real browser environment via Halo's `browser_run` — with access to the page DOM, cookies, and internal APIs, just like operating in the Chrome DevTools console. For example, here is the core code of a Bilibili notification reading Skill:

```js
// .claude/skills/bili-get-messages/index.js
async (params) => {
  // Directly call Bilibili's internal API — cookies are automatically included, no extra authentication needed
  const resp = await fetch('https://api.bilibili.com/x/msgfeed/reply?platform=web', {
    credentials: 'include'
  }).then(r => r.json())

  // Return structured data to the AI, which decides how to respond
  return {
    success: true,
    notifications: resp.data.items.map(item => ({
      user: item.user.nickname,
      comment: item.item.source_content,
      video_title: item.item.title
    }))
  }
}
```

When an AI Digital Human calls it, all it takes is: `browser_run({ file: "skills/bili-get-messages/index.js" })` — after getting the data, the AI decides which items need replies and how to reply.

For example, a Zhihu AI Digital Human's workflow:
1. AI decides: time to check for new invited questions
2. Calls `zhihu-creator-invited` Skill -> script automatically fetches the invitation list and returns structured data
3. AI judges: this question is worth answering, starts writing
4. Calls `zhihu-publish-answer` Skill -> script automatically fills the editor and publishes

AI makes the decisions, Skills handle the operations. Stable, repeatable, reliable.

There are already ready-made Skills for platforms like Bilibili, Zhihu, WeChat, Xiaohongshu, and more. The community can also contribute their own.

### Remote Access — Your Phone Is Your AI Remote Control

Once Remote Access is enabled, your phone / H5 / WeChat / Android client can all control the Halo on your desktop. During meetings, commuting, or even from a hospital bed (true story), check AI's work progress anytime and issue new instructions.

## The Story of Halo

In October 2025, a simple frustration: **I wanted to use Claude Code, but I was stuck in meetings all day.**

During a boring meeting, I thought: *What if I could control Claude Code on my home computer from my phone?*

Then came the second problem — non-technical colleagues wanted to use it too, but got stuck at installation. *"What's npm?"*

So I built Halo: a visual interface, one-click install, remote access. The first version took a few hours. Everything after that? **100% built by Halo itself.**

Now, we believe the next step is the **AI Workstation**: AI no longer needs someone watching to get work done. You set the goals, AI Digital Humans push forward autonomously 7x24. Writing code, running tests, monitoring deployments, generating reports — running continuously, with you only making decisions at key checkpoints.

That's what Halo is building.
